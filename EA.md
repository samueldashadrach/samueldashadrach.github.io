(Last updated June 2022)

I'm an engineering student at IIT Delhi. My past experience is in cryptocurrency and decentralised tech. I learnt of effective altruism around September 2021, and am now exploring EA-aligned research work. Thoughts and interests might update frequently.

**Current topics of interest:** better institutions, stable totalitarianism, AI impacts, AI alignment

**Profiles:** [EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/acylhalide), [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/samuel-shadrach)

I can provide access to my research proposals to CERI, CHERI, CLR or ALLFED if you need, please message me for the same.

I am keen on improving my research and writing capabilities and gaining experience. I am also keen on informal mentoring and advice.

Please find my CV below.
