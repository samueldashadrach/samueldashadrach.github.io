I'm an engineering student at IIT Delhi. My past experience is in cryptocurrency and decentralised tech. I am now exploring EA-aligned research.

**Topics of interest:** designing better institutions and incentive structures, x-risk reduction, stable totalitarianism.

**Profiles:** [EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/samuel-shadrach-1), [Substack (personal)](https://kroma.substack.com), [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/samuel-shadrach)

For sample posts please see EA forum or substack. I haven't received much support or feedback on these so I'd be super keen on that.

I am looking for a research training programme or internship for Summer 2022 to improve my research capability and gain experience.

My CV can be found here: [CV](../samuel cv ea dec 2021.pdf)
