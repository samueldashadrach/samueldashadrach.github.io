I'm an engineering student at IIT Delhi. My past experience is in cryptocurrency and decentralised tech. I am now exploring EA-aligned research.

Topics of interest include desinging better institutions and incentive structures, x-risk reduction and stable totalitarianism. Find posts and comments on EA forum and personal blog. I haven't received much formal support or feedback on these so I'm super keen on either of those.

**I am looking for a research training programme or internship for Summer 2022 to improve my research capability and gain experience.**
