I'm an engineering student at IIT Delhi. My past experience is in cryptocurrency and decentralised tech. I am now exploring EA-aligned research.

List of some things I'm curious about, along with some relevant posts. I haven't received much formal support or feedback on these so I'm super keen on either of those.
